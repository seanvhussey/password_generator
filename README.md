# **Password_Generator**

---

## In this assignment we were asked to create a random password generator that followed the specific guidelines of a client.

## I was able to produce functions that aligned with the requests of the user.

---

### I combined different variables like character sets and length of the password to produce a dataset that matched user choices.

### Additionally, i was able to take those parameters and successfully put them through a function that randomized the final product and produced a secure password.

---

#### Finally, i was able to take the product and make a button that displayed a randomized password in HTML format.

#### In this project i learned a lot about basic JavaScript functions and the logic that goes behind creating a working application.

##### I also began to understand the benefits of using _GitHub_ _flow_, how to utilize different branches and how to take on a project block by block.
